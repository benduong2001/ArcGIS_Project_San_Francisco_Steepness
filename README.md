# San_Francisco_Steepness
# Steepness in San Francisco:
This project was done for USP4 at UCSD, using the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software ArcGIS. 

San Francisco is well known for its hilly geography and steep inclines. This project is intended to provide maps that can be useful for the tourists who have difficulty navigating on steep terrain, such as the elderly, or wheelchair users.
