# Steepness in San Francisco:
This project was done for USP4 at UCSD, using the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software ArcGIS. 

San Francisco is well known for its hilly geography and steep inclines. Thus, assessing the city's topography is crucial to understanding the pedestrian wheelchair accessibility in certain parts of the city. This project is intended to provide maps that can be useful for the tourists who have difficulty navigating on steep terrain, such as the elderly, or wheelchair users. 

This project uses several complex methods in terms of spatial joining and conversion of contour line to gradients.
